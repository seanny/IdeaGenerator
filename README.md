# Idea Generator

This is a simple idea generator for game dev, movies, whatever.
I created this as a simple project to learn C# outside of the Unity environment.

Truth be told, because of my prior 3+ years of expierience with Unity, I managed to create this in a period of roughly one hour.
I'v also packaged it for release so that it can be used w/o needing to use `dotnet` or `mono`.

This is also licensed under MIT so that it can be used with fairly minimal restrictions.

Seanny.
